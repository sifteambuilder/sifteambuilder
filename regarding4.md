## Regarding Ver. 4.0

The 4.0 update to the JP server brought about numerous changes to the game mechanics and drastically changed how song scores are calculated, and consequently the ways to form an optimal Scorer team. Listed below are additional variables affecting song score in Ver. 4.0, and whether their effects are been accounted for by this Team Builder:


☑      10% bonus to cards whose idol belongs to selected song's idol unit

☐      Equipped School-Idol-Skills

☐      Center card's secondary leader skill

☐      Guest center's secondary leader skill
